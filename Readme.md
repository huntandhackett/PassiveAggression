# Passive Aggression
This repo contains test samples and proof-of-concept code for achieving passive persistence in Active Directory (AD) environments, even after remediation efforts. Some of these techniques may result in an eternal persistence scenario, where an attacker does not need to have access to domain controllers or domain joined machines, allowing them to continuously persist in the network without detection. 

More PoCs and samples will be added in the coming weeks.
